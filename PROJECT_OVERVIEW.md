### Core Components

#### 1. Game Engine (`engine.py`)
- **GameState Class**: Central game state management and rule enforcement
- **Move Class**: Encapsulates chess moves with metadata and validation
- **CastleRights Class**: Tracks castling availability for both players
- **Move Generation**: Comprehensive algorithms for all piece types
- **State Validation**: Pin detection, check verification, and legal move filtering

#### 2. AI Engine (`chessAi.py`)
- **Minimax Implementation**: Classic game tree search with alpha-beta pruning
- **Evaluation Function**: Multi-factor position assessment including:
  - Material balance (piece values)
  - Positional factors (piece-square tables)
  - Special conditions (checkmate, stalemate)
- **Search Optimization**: Alpha-beta pruning for efficient tree traversal
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Configurable search depth for varying AI strength

#### 3. User Interface (`main.py`)
- **Event System**: Mouse and keyboard input handling
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Board, piece, and UI element drawing
- **Animation System**: Smooth piece movement and visual transitions
- **Sound Management**: Audio feedback for different game events
- **Game Flow Control**: Turn management and mode switching

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Model**: `engine.py` (game state and rules) - Object-oriented game logic
- **View**: `main.py` rendering functions
- **Controller**: `main.py` event handling and game flow

### 2. Strategy Pattern
- Different piece movement strategies in move generation using polymorphic methods
- Configurable AI evaluation strategies through method delegation

### 3. Command Pattern
- Move objects encapsulate actions with undo capability using OOP encapsulation
- State history management for game replay through object composition

### 4. Observer Pattern
- Game state changes trigger UI updates through method callbacks
- Move logging and state synchronization using object notifications

### 5. Object-Oriented Principles Applied
- **Encapsulation**: Game state and behavior bundled in classes
- **Abstraction**: Complex chess rules simplified through class interfaces
- **Composition**: Complex objects built from simpler component objects
- **Polymorphism**: Different piece types handled through common interfaces
